# CampusCoin ðŸŽ“ðŸ’°

CampusCoin is a **Move smart contract** built on the Aptos blockchain.  
It implements a managed fungible asset (token) designed specifically for **college campuses**.  

The main idea:  
- **College admins** can mint and distribute CampusCoins to students as incentives (e.g., for attendance, participation, or achievements).  
- **Students** can spend these tokens with approved campus vendors (canteens, stationery shops, etc.).  
- **Admins** retain full control, including minting, burning, freezing/unfreezing accounts, and managing transfers.

## ðŸ›  How It Works

1. **Deploy the module** â†’ The deployer (college admin) automatically creates the CampusCoin asset.  
2. **Minting** â†’ Admin mints coins into student wallets.  
3. **Spending** â†’ Students pay vendors in CampusCoins.  
4. **Admin Controls** â†’ Admin can freeze/unfreeze accounts or burn tokens when necessary.

## ðŸš€ Example Use Case

1. College admin deploys `CampusCoin::fa_coin`.  
2. A student receives `100 CC` as a reward for good performance.  
3. The student spends `20 CC` at the canteen.  
4. The admin burns unused tokens at the end of the semester.

## ðŸ“¦ Testing

The module includes built-in Move tests:  
- `test_basic_flow` â†’ Covers initialization, minting, freezing, transferring, unfreezing, and burning.  
- `test_permission_denied` â†’ Ensures only the admin can mint CampusCoins.  

Run tests with:
```bash
aptos move test
